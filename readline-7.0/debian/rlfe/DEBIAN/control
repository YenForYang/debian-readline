Description: Front-end using readline to "cook" input lines for other programs
 This tool lets you use history and line-editing in any text oriented
 tool. This is especially useful with third-party proprietary tools that
 cannot be distributed linked against readline. It is not perfect but it
 works pretty well.
 .
 See the ledit and rlwrap packages for other programs of that kind.
